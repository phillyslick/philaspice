2nd - the product list. will change a bit but that's basically what it is.
there may be an add to cart button on the product list beside each pull down.  so return customers who know what they want wouldn't have to click in to the product page.
3rd - internal product page ("anise") is pretty much as it'll be.  sizes will change a bit. and the image window is going to be 3:2 like the images that come out of cameras.  but this is basically it.

4th - the "thank you" page, which is the small one at the top of this column here, is the cart.  it's basically as it will be.  no header.  in general the header will be like on the anise page, but wither without the glow or with some spice image worked behind the nav.  // below the cart is a very rough draft from before of the "edit item page which would be reached by clicking on a line item in the cart.  it'll look more like the cart. // so too with the checkout page below that.

5th - the contact form.  basically like this.

6th - the about page.  basically like this.

7th - that's it, but there might be a "featured" page?  or maybe not.

lemme know if you have any questions or anything.

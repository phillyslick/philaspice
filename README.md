#Notes

###Products 
- Products are never created on their own.  They always work in tandem with variants.

###Variants
- Need to see if he uses SKUs


#NEXT
- Categories (prototypes)
- Images (you have to update Product.featured to include(:images), because a featured product has to have an image) see product.rb:: self.featured
- STOCK - how is he handling stock? - I'm thinking just boolean, which would let me skip inventory for now..
- All Properties, figure out how to do this at every level - if you even want them at all levels

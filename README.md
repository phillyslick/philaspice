#Notes

###Products 
- Products are never created on their own.  They always work in tandem with variants.

###Variants
Need to see if he uses SKUs


#NEXT
- Categories (prototypes)
- Images (you have to update Product.featured to include(:images), because a featured product has to have an image) see product.rb:: self.featured
